## Why Document Generation?

Every knowledge-heavy team now needs living documents: contracts that adapt to policy changes, product guides that stay perfectly aligned with release notes, and onboarding packets that personalize themself per audience. Epistola exists to turn that difficult promise into a repeatable workflow. This blog will document the patterns, architectures, and experiments that get us there.

## What We'll Cover

### DocOps Foundations

We'll break down the building blocks of a resilient document pipeline: schema design, versioned templates, approval flows, and verifiable delivery. Expect actionable walkthroughs with real configuration snippets you can drop into your own Epistola workspace.

### Applied Automation

Document generation only works when it reaches the last mile. We'll show how to:

- Connect Epistola to CRMs, ERP systems, or data warehouses
- Map structured data into branded layouts using Liquid, Nunjucks, or MJML
- Render to PDF, DOCX, HTML, and email simultaneously
- Orchestrate deployments using queues, workers, and audit logs

### Quality and Compliance

Precision matters. We'll share validation strategies, regression testing techniques, and redlining workflows that keep generated documents trustworthy for legal, financial, and regulated teams.

### Product Updates

When we ship new rendering engines, layout tooling, or collaboration features, this is where you'll see deep dives, not just release notes.
