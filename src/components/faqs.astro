    question: "How fast can we launch?",
    answer:
      "Most teams move from the demo environment to production in about 6 weeks. We help migrate a core set of templates and connect your orchestrator so you stay focused on your product.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Epistola connect to our legacy systems?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We provide adapters for major CRMs, loan origination, core banking, and signature vendors. Our platform exposes REST/GraphQL APIs and event hooks for everything else.",

  {
    question: "How is compliance handled?",

  },
  {
    question: "What support is included?",
